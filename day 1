Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing,developing,testing and maintaining software systems. software engineering 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
designing

developing
testing
maintaining


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
waterfall
we have classical waterfall model and iterative waterfall model. Classical waterfall model is considered as the theoritical way of developing software. All other models are derived from derived from this model.Iterative waterfall model provides backup and paths for error as and when detected later in a phase.
prototype
it exhibits limited functional capabilities,low reliabilities and inefficient performance compared to actual software. A prototype is built using several shortcuts that involve using inefficient,inacurate or dummy functions.
spiral model
it is a meta model that encompases all other models.spiral model is suitable for development of technically challenging software products that are prone to several risks. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall model follows a sequential design process while agile model measures progress in terms of developed and delivered functionalities.
waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages where agile promotes ongoing collaborations.
waterfall has fixed upfront costs that can lead to higher expenses if changes are needed where agile may seem more expensive due to its ongoing loops but again reduces expenses overtime by adressing issues early.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
to design,program,build,deploy and maintain software using skills and tools.
quality assurance engineer
ensures software passes all checks before its releasesto the public.
project manager
project planning,leadership,activity monitoring,time management,budjeting,communication,risk analysis,resourse management and change management.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
advancement in technology over and over which can be solved by being informed of the near future and make flexible software products.
time constraints which can be overcomed by time management and having flexible deadlines so that not much pressure affects the software engineers.
testing conflicts that arises beetwen the engineers and testers which can be overcomed by taking time to perfect the project and give it time so as to perfect it.
growing customer demand that can be solved by handling a project with a great understanding underlying business aspects that fit the customers needs.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit
where individual units of the software are tested
intergration
is a type of sotware testing in which individual software components are logically intergrated and tested as a group.
system
it is software testing in which all components are tested together to ensure that final product meets the specified requirement.
acceptance
determines whether or not the software should be released publicly.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outputs.it is important because it creates high quality and relevant output.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
n shot
chain of thought
general knowledge prompting
